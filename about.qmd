## Quick Pitch: Shaon Lahiri

I am an interdisciplinary social & behavioral scientist based in the field of public health. My area of expertise is on the conceptualization, measurement, and analysis of social norms as they impact behavior, especially health-related behaviors. I employ a mixed-methods toolbelt when approaching research projects that aim to change behavior that have covered areas as diverse as women's labor force participation in the Middle East and North Africa, reducing tobacco use, increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis use among Black women in Washington DC, increasing modern contraception use in Kenya, understanding the social dimensions of poverty in the US, promoting latrine use in rural India, and reducing intimate partner violence in Rwanda.

In short, **behavior change is my business, and business is hard!**

### Detailed Summary

**Postdoctoral Researcher** in the Philosophy, Politics & Economics program (2022 - present) \| University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

::: callout-note
## Responsibilities

I create and teach courses to advanced undergraduates in the Philosophy, Politics & Economics (PPE) program at the University of Pennsylvania. PPE is among the largest majors at the University of Pennsylvania, and continues to grow each year. Though the name is *PPE*, inspired by the model made famous by Oxford University in the 1920s, our program has a hidden 'P' of Psychology. That's where I come in. I create and teach seminars based in psychology for PPE majors (typically in their third or fourth years). You will find more information on these courses in the Teaching section of this website. I also mentor and advise students on honors theses and independent studies in topics of interest to them in the world of the social & behavioral sciences.
