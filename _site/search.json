    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nOpen defecation represents a major social and health burden for individuals, families and societies. India alone accounts for approximately 60 per cent of the global population defecating in the open, with the majority residing in rural India. Open defecation spreads diseases such as diarrhoea, schistosomiasis and trachoma and results in stunting and malnutrition of children. It can be dangerous and represent an affront to the dignity of vulnerable groups such as women, adolescent girls, the elderly and individuals with disabilities.\nThis scoping study informs the focus of 3ie’s thematic window on Promoting Latrine Use in Rural India. It examines the state of rigorous evidence regarding latrine use in rural India, as well as benefitting from a consultation with experts and a field visit. We conducted a systematic literature search in March 2016 to answer the research question, ‘What is the state of quantitative evidence of latrine use in rural India?’ We were interested only in completed quantitative studies that examine latrine use as a primary or secondary outcome. Only 11 studies met inclusion criteria, and of these, four studies used experimental study designs. The marked lack of studies measuring causal change represents a critical knowledge gap and priority area that needs to be addressed by future research.\nWe find that the most frequently cited barriers to latrine use were knowledge, attitudes and practices related to latrine use and poor quality of latrines. Latrine use is measured in various ways. The most common method is surveys that solicit self-reported latrine use in a household. We also examine correlations between latrine use and different subgroups and explore demand-driven approaches to promoting latrine use. The most common approaches to encourage demand in rural India are community mobilisation, such as Community-Led Total Sanitation. A clear finding from our review is that latrine design and functionality are important determinants of latrine use. Knowledge, attitudes and practices that inhibit latrine use must be addressed through reframing latrines as attractive commodities.\nOur findings lead to several recommendations for future research. First, effective sanitation efforts must give adequate weight to the sociohistorical nature of entrenched behaviours that have been reinforced by generations of habit. Shifting these behaviours requires multilevel interventions that target multiple determinants of behaviour. The use of psychosocial theories of behaviour change allows for a framework in which different intervention components can be tested. Second, sanitation efforts must conduct appropriate disaggregated and formative analyses to address the differential needs of and programme impacts on vulnerable populations such as women, children, individuals from lower socioeconomic classes and scheduled castes and tribes. Third, measuring latrine use is difficult, relies primarily on self-reporting and observation and is prone to bias. Future efforts should explore triangulating the measurement of latrine use through disaggregated survey instruments that combine observation and self-reporting."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nResearch in diverse fields has examined how social and gender norms, broadly defined as informal rules of acceptable behavior in a given group or society, may influence sexual and reproductive health outcomes. One set of conceptual and empirical approaches has focused on perceptions of how commonly others perform a behavior and the extent to which others support or approve of the behavior. Another set of approaches has focused on how social norms emerge from structures of gender and power that characterize the social institutions within which individuals are embedded. Interventions intended to improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes by shifting social and gender norms have been applied across a wide range of populations and settings and to a diverse set of behaviors, including female genital mutilation/cutting, the use of modern contraceptive methods, and behavioral risk reduction for HIV. Norms-based intervention strategies have been implemented at multiple socioecological levels and have taken a variety of forms, including leveraging the influence of prominent individuals, using community activities or mass media to shift attitudes, and introducing legislation or policies that facilitate the changing of social norms.\nRecent advances in social and gender norms scholarship include the integration of previously disparate conceptual and empirical approaches into a unified multilevel framework. Although challenges remain in measuring social and gender norms and studying their impacts on sexual and reproductive health-related behaviors across cultures, the research will continue to shape policies and programs that impact sexual and reproductive health globally."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAchieving more equitable, safer, and resilient societies—crucial dimensions of social sustainability—depends on durable transformations in people's behavior. Traditional policy interventions attempt to influence people's behavior in different ways, such as increased policing, fines, or awareness campaigns, but often have limited effects because they fail to systematically address local determinants of behavior. In this paper, we analyze two complex behavioral policy interventions to illustrate how installation theory can provide a framework to systematically analyze and design for large-scale behavioral change to support social sustainability. We focus on two of Antanas Mockus' iconic \"civic culture\" interventions to reduce deaths in traffic accidents and domestic violence in Colombia. To study them, we collected intervention reports, citizens' narratives, creators' accounts and press articles to identify their main characteristics and behavioral techniques. In our results, we find that the civic culture approach used in these two interventions addresses physical, psychological and social determinants of behavior in ways that reduce reactance and promote mutual regulation and collective agency. By unraveling the essential factors of behavioral influence, installation theory and related frameworks provide a useful guide to structure, analyze and report interventions that address the behavioral components of social sustainability."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe belief that contraceptive use causes infertility has been documented across sub-Saharan Africa, but its quantitative association with actual contraceptive use has not been examined. We collected and analyzed sociocentric network data covering 74 percent of the population in two villages in rural Kenya. We asked respondents to nominate people from their village (their network), and then we matched their network (alters) to the individual participant (ego) to understand how their beliefs and behaviors differ. We asked about contraceptive use and level of agreement with a statement about contraceptive use causing infertility. We calculated the average nominated network contraceptive use score and the average nominated network belief score. Holding the individual belief that contraceptive use causes infertility was associated with lower odds of using contraceptive (AOR = 0.82, p = &lt; 0.01); however, when one’s own nominated network connections held this belief, the odds of using contraceptive were even lower (AOR = 0.75, p &lt;0.01). Our findings show that this belief is associated with lower odds of contraceptive use and highlights the role that other people in one’s network play in reinforcing it. Sexual and reproductive health programs should address this misperception at the individual and social network level."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nPurpose\nDespite Kenya’s encouraging progress in increasing access to modern contraception among youth, several barriers remain preventing large-scale efforts to reduce demand-side unmet need for family planning. Shifting social norms around the use and acceptability of modern contraception may represent a potent target for future interventions. However, the structure of normative influence on individual modern contraceptive use among youth needs to be determined. Therefore, our aim was to estimate the influence of individual and group-level normative influence on modern contraceptive use among adolescents from two villages in rural Kenya.\n\n\nMethods\nTrained enumerators collected data from individuals aged 15–24 who provided oral informed consent, or parental informed consent, in two villages in rural Kilifi county. Participants completed a questionnaire related to modern contraceptive use and were asked to nominate one to five people (referents) with whom they spend free time. The enumerators photographed each individual who nominated at least one referent using Android phones and matched them with their nominated referents. Using this social network data, we estimated group-level normative influence by taking an average of referents’ modern contraception use. We then explored associations between descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and network modern contraceptive use on individual modern contraceptive use, controlling for known confounders using logistic regression models. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to test a pattern of differential referent influence on individual modern contraceptive use.\n\n\nResults\nThere was a positive association between pro-modern contraception descriptive and injunctive norms and individual modern contraception use (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05–1.6, and aOR = 1.31, CI = 1.06–1.62, respectively). Network modern contraceptive use was associated with individual use in the bivariate model (aOR = 2.57, CI = 1.6–4.12), but not in the multivariable model (aOR = 1.67, CI = 0.98–2.87). When stratified by sex and marital status, network modern contraceptive use was associated with individual modern contraceptive use among female participants (aOR = 2.9, CI = 1.31–6.42), and unmarried female participants (aOR = 5.26, CI = 1.34–20.69), but not among males. No interactive effects between norms variables were detected. Sensitivity analyses with a different estimate of network modern contraceptive use showed similar results.\n\n\nConclusions\nSocial norms are multilevel phenomena that influence youth modern contraceptive use, especially among young women in rural Kenya. Unmarried women with modern contraceptive users in their social network may feel less stigma to use contraception themselves. This may reflect gendered differences in norms and social influence effects for modern contraceptive use. Future research should investigate group-level normative influence in relation to family planning behaviors."

    "text": "Abstract\nTobacco use kills more than eight million individuals each year, and results in substantial economic and human capital loss across nations. While effective supply-side solutions to tobacco control exist, these approaches are less effective at promoting cessation among heavy smokers, and less feasible to implement in countries with weaker tobacco control policy environments. Thus, effective demand-side solutions are needed. Shifting social norms around tobacco use is one such promising approach. To this end, a systematic review and meta-analysis of social norms intervention studies to influence tobacco use will be conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidance. Tobacco intervention studies with at least two time points that explicitly mention social norms or social influence as part of an intervention or set of measured variables will be included. Literature sources will comprise PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Trial Registry, as well as several grey literature sources. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, and risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and ROBINS-I tools. The primary outcomes will be change in tobacco use and change in social norms. A random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted for both outcomes. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored using meta-regression with key covariates. Non-reporting biases will be explored using funnel plots. PROSPERO: CRD42021251535."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecent evaluations have begun to use qualitative data in a manner that helps improve the quality and relevance of studies through the inferences that are drawn from them, and their applicability to policy makers and programme implementers. This paper reviews this work and identifies good practices to integrate qualitative methods into quantitative impact evaluations (IEs) and systematic reviews (SRs). Using recent literature on the characteristics of such practices, we developed two tools to assess the methodological rigour and mixed methods integration of 40 IEs and 7 SRs, drawing upon previous approaches. Our findings are that successful mixed methods quantitative impact evaluations: (1) provide a clear rationale for integration of methods; (2) deploy multidisciplinary teams; (3) provide adequate documentation; and (4) acknowledge limitations to the generalisability of qualitative and quantitative findings. Successful integration tended to improve mixed methods impact evaluations by collecting better data to inform the study design and findings, which helped contextualise quantitative findings. Our main observation on the integration of mixed methods in the systematic reviews is that mixed methods systematic reviews bringing together literatures that answer different questions can go beyond the ‘sum of their parts’ to provide holistic answers about development effectiveness. The findings of this study inform several recommendations to improve the conduct and reporting of mixed methods impact evaluations and systematic reviews."

    "text": "Abstract\nNonpharmacological treatment strategies that originate from sociocultural teachings and are beyond the scope of allopathic medicine are commonly used among people with epilepsy (PWE) in many parts of the world. The present study explored the types and sociodemographic correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among PWE in Oman among attendees of a neurological unit at a tertiary care center. Data on the types of CAM were gathered from telephone interviews. The relevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were obtained from electronic medical records. Of the total of 101 participants, 73.3% were CAM users. The majority of these participants have not disclosed their CAM use to their allopathic health-care providers. The most common types of CAM reported were those falling under the 'mind–body' type (incantations and fumigation) and biologically based (herbal concoctions) or a combination of them. Compared to non-CAM users, a significant and greater proportion of CAM users attributed the etiology of their illness to nonbiomedical factors such as 'evil eyes' (P = 0.04). The multivariate logistic regression model indicated that the use of CAM was highly associated with age of &lt; 30 years (OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.46), unemployment (OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.15, 6.39), having basic school education (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.83, 5.18), low family income (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 0.91, 2.11), and the presence of hypersalivation (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.39). Further studies are needed to harmonize these two healing practices. On the whole, this study indicates that among attendees of tertiary care utilization, CAM is common among PWE in Oman. The most utilized type of CAM falls under the umbrella of mind–body practice."

    "text": "Abstract\nOur aim was to systematically review how social functioning is measured, conceptualised, impacted, and associated with mental disorders in populations affected by humanitarian crises. Quantitative studies conducted with civilian populations affected by humanitarian crises in low- and middle-income countries with outcomes of social functioning were examined up to 2014. Data sources included Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Global Health, and 8 grey literature sources, yielding 14,350 records, of which 20 studies met inclusion criteria. A descriptive synthesis analysis was used, and the final selected studies assessed for quality using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In the 20 studies, social functioning was conceptualised in 6 categories: family functioning, friendship quality, functional impairment, overall social functioning, social adaptation, and social relations. Seventeen studies were cross-sectional, two were cohort, and one a controlled trial. The quality of the studies was generally moderate. The limited evidence suggests that social functioning is a relevant variable. Greater crisis exposure is associated with more severe depression and lower social functioning. The protective role of familial and social resources for social functioning is highlighted in different crisis settings. However, greater research on social functioning and mental health is required."

    "text": "Abstract\nCross-disciplinary (multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary) teams are increasingly recognized as crucial alliances required for solving complex problems, particularly those attributable to natural disasters. Despite this recognition, there has been limited research examining the factors necessary for successful cross-disciplinary collaboration at the outset of a research initiative to address natural disaster preparedness and response. The purpose of this study was to explore the facilitators of and barriers to such collaboration through a case study of a multidisciplinary research initiative at an urban East Coast university in the United States. Using an applied qualitative approach, we conducted individual semi-structured interviews with initiative members to explore facilitators and barriers to natural disaster preparedness and response, and initiative members’ attitudes, perceptions, and expectations regarding multidisciplinary collaboration. We identified several common themes across natural disaster preparedness and response efforts and multidisciplinary research collaborations, such as greater human and financial resources. Additionally, we identified several themes unique to perceptions of multidisciplinary research collaboration, such as the importance of clearly defined structures, and the needs of all parties being met. Findings may serve as a framework for multidisciplinary academic collaborations preparing for and responding to natural disasters, as well as multidisciplinary collaboration in general."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nOver the past decade, there has been rapid growth in the evidence for programs to prevent or reduce intimate partner violence (IPV)–the most common form of men’s violence against women. IPV interventions targeting heterosexual couples have shown significant impact. However, our understanding of how these interventions achieve their impacts on violence–the mechanisms through which change occurs–remains limited. Using data from two follow-up rounds of a randomized controlled trial of the Bandebereho intervention in Rwanda, we constructed conceptually driven structural equation models to represent the processes by which hypothesized mediating variables linked treatment assignment to IPV. We found significant differences in the expected direction between the intervention and control participants on all mediating variables, including men’s alcohol use, communication frequency, emotional closeness, frequency of quarreling, and men’s attitudes related to gender and violence. Several mechanisms–more positive couple dynamics including emotional closeness and communication frequency; men’s gender-equitable attitudes; men’s alcohol use–accounted for the largest proportions of the effect of assignment to the Bandebereho intervention on IPV. Overall, our findings highlight that no one particular component is driving the reductions in violence; instead, the multiple components and pathways account for the intervention’s effects, suggesting that the holistic nature of the intervention may be integral to its positive impact. The Bandebereho trial from which data was used in this analysis was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov prior to completion (NCT02694627)."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nGiven the anticipated health challenges, forecasted deficiencies in the global health workforce, and steady demands to work through resource constraints, effective and efficient training approaches to build capacity are direly needed. Although train-the-trainer (T3) is not a new approach, there has been considerable interest in using it to develop and sustain capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This systematic review aimed to better understand the factors to achieve and sustain change across multiple countries and levels through T3 approaches.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature search was conducted of six scholarly, peer-reviewed, and gray literature databases. Data were extracted for the study method, design, characteristics, and implicit or explicit factors related to maximizing the likelihood of achieving and sustaining change. An existing conceptual framework for T3 interventions in global health guided the thematic analysis. The framework consisted of five factors pertinent to capacity building T3 initiatives: Talent, Resources, Alignment, Implementation, and Nurture and Development.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. The T3 training spanned all geographical regions, but interventions were most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (46%). Nearly all studies (68%) quantitatively examined change at the individual level (95%), but some studies also explored change at the organizational (77%) and institutional (23%) levels. Implementation and Nurture/Development were the two most salient factors in achieving and sustaining change. The greatest hindrances involved Resources and Context, an additional theme that the data identified.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings and recommendations from this first systematic review exploring antecedents influencing change through health-related T3 interventions can inform training and capacity-building investments, improve existing T3 initiatives, and steer planning for future approaches."
