PPE is among the largest majors at the University of Pennsylvania, and continues to grow each year. Though the name is PPE, inspired by the model made famous by Oxford University in the 1920s, our program has a hidden ‘P’ of Psychology. That’s where I come in. I create and teach seminars based in psychology for PPE majors (typically in their third or fourth years). You will find more information on these courses in the Teaching section of this website. I also mentor and advise students on honors theses and independent studies in topics of interest to them in the world of the social & behavioral sciences.\n\n\nGraduate Teaching Assistant & Adjunct Lecturer in the Milken Institute School of Public Health (2018 - 2022) | The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nI assisted faculty in teaching several public health courses to undergraduates and Master’s students. More details on these courses can be found in the Teaching section of this website. As an adjunct lecturer in the GW online MPH program for the 2021 - 2022 academic year, I was the sole instructor of a course on research methods. The work also involved designing activities and assessments to supplement class teaching, mentoring students on their research and educational projects, and providing guest lectures on various public health topics.\n\n\nResearch Associate in the Evaluation Office (2016 - 2018) | The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), New Delhi, India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nI supported the establishment and management of a $4 million program to promote latrine use in rural India funded by the Gates Foundation. This involved grant management and administrative support related to the progress of nine formative studies, four impact evaluations, and one measurement study all conducted in rural India. I also supported the funding of a large program to improve the use of evidence in policy among a number of West African countries. The work also involved authoring manuscripts, writing grant proposals, presenting at conferences, teaching workshops, and support the mission of the organization in diverse ways.\n\n\nProject Assistant (2014 - 2015) | UNICEF Oman, Muscat, Oman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nI supported the Country Representative and Operations Chief in the Oman country office with various tasks related to the UNICEF’s Oman program. These included assisting with organizing conferences with relevant government line ministries, and supporting a consulting team with administrative support in their program to develop a national safety net program for the country. My responsibilities also included working with private industries to support ongoing programs by the Ministry of Health.\n\n\nResearch Assistant (2010 - 2012) | Addiction Research Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nI worked with a postdoctoral scholar on research projects related to alcohol addiction. My responsibilities mainly involved data entry for a longitudinal project on understanding trajectories of alcohol addiction, and qualitative coding for three treatment manuals for alcohol addiction. The work also involved drafting a manuscript on the role of positive psychology on treatment for alcohol addiction."
