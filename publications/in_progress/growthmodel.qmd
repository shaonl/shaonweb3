By fitting several latent growth models, we demonstrate that the influence of social norms on tobacco use for adult smokers in Mainland China exerts a significant effect on tobacco use over time, controlling for several factors such as level of addiction, exposure to pro-tobacco media, and many more. The paper also leverages a Bayesian estimator to fit a high-dimensional latent growth model. The data cover five waves of measurement over nine years, comprising a longitudinal sample of over 1,000 individuals.
