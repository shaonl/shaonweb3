Through a systematic review, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions, we show that the evidence for social norms interventions on tobacco use is strong. Social norms interventions significantly change both social normative perceptions around tobacco use, as well as actual tobacco use. Several social norms change mechanisms are discussed, as well as a previously unrecognized mechanism based on Social Inoculation Theory.
