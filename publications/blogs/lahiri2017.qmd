## Abstract

I discuss the findings of a recent systematic review to understanding promoting latrine use in Rural India. In particular, I highlight factors associated with successful latrine construction such as constructing a latrine's with one's own resources and to one's own specifications. I also discuss the paucity of theory-driven interventions in the space, and ethical issues that are emerging from the largest behavior change program in modern history. Finally, I discuss the difficulties in survey measurement related to understanding latrine use in rural India.
